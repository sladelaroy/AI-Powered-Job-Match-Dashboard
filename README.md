# AI-Powered Job Match Dashboard

## Objective
The AI-Powered Job Match Dashboard is a mini job matching application built using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. This project displays job recommendations along with their match scores, allowing users to apply for jobs while demonstrating API handling and UI/UX skills.

## Project Requirements

### 1. UI Components
- **Job List Component**: Displays job recommendations with title, company, location, salary range, and match score.
- **Match Score Visualization**: Shows how well the user fits each job using a color-coded progress bar.
  - Green (80%+), Yellow (50-79%), Red (<50%).
- **Job Details Component**: Opens a modal or new page with job details and required skills upon clicking a job.
- **Apply Now Button**: Allows users to apply (mock action) and alerts if skills are missing.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly UI that adapts to different screen sizes.

### 2. API Handling
- **Mock Job Data API**: Fetch job listings from a mock API or local JSON file and display them dynamically.
- **Dynamic User Data Simulation**: Simulate user skills and compare them with job requirements to calculate match scores.
